This is the README for LULESH 2.0 using OpenMP 4.0

This is meant to be an example of how we would port this type of code to OpenMp 4.0 for use for performance portability with or without accelerators.

Options:
- The default number of teams and threads is set. You can customize these parameters by changing the build options (make TEAMS=512 THREADS=256) or the #defines at the top of the code.
- The default device is the GPU but it can be disabled by passing the USE_GPU=0 to the Makefile.

Warning: Performance may vary based on your OpenMP 4.0 implementation.

More information including LULESH 1.0 can be found at https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php

If you have any questions or problems please contact:

Ian Karlin <karlin1@llnl.gov>
Jeff Keasler <keasler1@llnl.gov> or
Gheorghe-Teodor Bercea <gbercea@us.ibm.com>

Also please send any notable results to Ian Karlin <karlin1@llnl.gov> and Gheorghe-Teodor Bercea <gbercea@us.ibm.com> as we are still evaluating the performance of this code.

*** Notable changes in LULESH 2.0 ***

Split functionality into different files
lulesh.cc - where most (all?) of the timed functionality lies
lulesh-comm.cc - MPI functionality
lulesh-init.cc - Setup code
lulesh-viz.cc  - Support for visualization option
lulesh-util.cc - Non-timed functions

Deviations from the base implementation:
- Mergeing of some functions/loops.
- Refactoring of the loop over material properties.
- Move exit() and MPI_Abort() functions outside `target` regions.
